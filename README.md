- âš¡ Fun fact: "The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, a mathematician who worked on
      Charles Babbageâ€™s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, in the mid-1800s.
      She wrote what is now considered the first algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine, making
       her the world's first coderâ€”long before modern computers existed."
